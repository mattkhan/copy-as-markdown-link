# Copy as Markdown Link

A browser extension to copy selections on webpages as markdown links. Versions 2 and 3 for manifest.json are supported in `v2` and `v3` respectively.

## Usage

Example:

1. Highlight "Example Domain" on https://example.com/
2. Cmd+Shift+L

`[Example Domain](https://example.com/)` will be in your clipboard.

Cmd+Shift+L without a selection will put `[](https://example.com/)` in your clipboard.
